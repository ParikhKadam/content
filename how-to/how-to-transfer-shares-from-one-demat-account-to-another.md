# How to transfer shares from one demat account to another

## Intro 👋

**DP \(Depository Participant\)**: The broker who coordinates with the National Depository to keep our shares, debentures etc. in electronic form

**National Depository**: Government registered share depositories. There are two in India

1. CDSL \(Central Depositories Services India Ltd\)
2. NSDL \(National Securities Depository Ltd\)

Depending on to which National Depository both the DP \(From where you want transfer and to where\) are associated with, the procedure for transfer are different.

## Steps for transferring👩🏽‍🏫

### Transfer Online 💻 <a id="Transfer-Online"></a>

Online transfer will only work if the national depository of both the to & from stock broker is the same.  
List of DPs offering Online transfer- [NSDL](https://nsdl.co.in/speed-e.php), [CDSL](https://www.cdslindia.com/DP/dplist.aspx)

CDSL Provides an online platform \(EasiEasiest\) for submitting off-market, on-market, inter-depository and early pay-in debit instructions from ones demat account. Below are the steps to use that facility to transfer shares from one DP to another

1. Register for ‘Easiest’ facility: [https://web.cdslindia.com/myeasi/Home/Login](https://web.cdslindia.com/myeasi/Home/Login)
2. Provide the details of DP from where you need to transfer the shares while registering
3. Add the Trusted account by giving DP details to where you need to transfer the shares
4. Go to Setup -&gt; Bulk setup -&gt; Transaction
5. Select the added trusted account to which you need to transfer the share and provide the needed details
6. After successful verification, the transfer procedure will start

Similarly NSDL got Speed-e service which offers similar functions if your DP supports e-DIS.

### Transfer Offline 📄 <a id="Transfer-Offline"></a>

Please try offline transfer only if the online option doesn’t work or you have to transfer shares between an NSDL and CDSL linked DP. 

Please note that you may have to pay the charges for the DIS slip and its postal charges if you opt this route.

1. Get the DIS \(Delivery Instruction slip\) from your existing stock broker
2. Fill DIS with
   * Demat account number & DP ID of the account to which you need to transfer the shares
   * Name of security/company and it’s ISIN number
3. Send the DIS along with the CMR \(Client master report\) copy to the new account provider
4. In 3-4 days after the receipt of the DIS, the shares should reflect in your new account

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are closing the old account, you can fill the details of the account to which you need to transfer the shares. This will eliminate any transfer fees
{% endhint %}
